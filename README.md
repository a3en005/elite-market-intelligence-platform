- **Charts**: TradingView Lightweight Charts & Widgets.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture:

1.  **Server (`server.ts`)**:
    -   Acts as a proxy to external financial APIs to hide sensitive keys and bypass CORS.
    -   Implements a caching layer to optimize API usage and prevent rate limiting.
    -   Manages a WebSocket server for broadcasting real-time price fluctuations to all connected clients.
2.  **Frontend Services (`src/services/`)**:
    -   `priceService.ts`: Handles initial data fetching and WebSocket connection management.
    -   `newsService.ts`: Fetches and processes economic calendar events.
3.  **UI Components (`src/components/`)**:
    -   Modularized components for the Asset List, Chart View, Session Tracker, and News Feed.
    -   Responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

## 🔑 Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for full functionality:

## 📈 API Integration Details

- **Forex/Indices/Metals**: Primary data is sourced from OANDA's institutional-grade pricing engine.
- **Crypto**: Real-time ticker data is pulled from Binance's 24hr ticker endpoint.
- **Fallback**: In case of primary API failure, the system seamlessly switches to ExchangeRate-API for FX and Binance Public API for Crypto to ensure zero downtime.
